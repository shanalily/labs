  <h1>Lab 11</h1>
  <h2>Task 1</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I set up Pidgin as an IRC client.</li>
      <li>I tried connecting to the #a11y channel for the GNOME Accessibility Team, and someone else connected
      around the same time and saw the message I sent, so we connected to the same channel, but it was in French
      so I don't think it was the correct channel. I looked at the RCOS #general slack channel instead. People
      shared links to videos, articles, and other media that might be interesting to students interested in
      open source software and computer science. People also asked questions about events, such as location and dress
      code, or advertised RCOS events, such as mentioning there was pizza. Questions about code and projects were in
      another channel, as were official announcements made by the professor. Sillier posts were not posted in the
      #general channel and were instead posted in #random.</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Task 2</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I used a web-based client (kiwiirc) to connect to the #sourceforge channel. It was a lot clearer where to enter
      commands in kiwiirc than in Pidgin or other places I had tried. I used the /me command to say "/me says hi!".</li>
      <li>I wrote a line in the Titanpad document</li>
      <li></li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Task 3</h2>
    <ul>
      I'm using the channel for CSCI-2963.
      <li>Name: CSCI-2963</li>
      <li>Website: <a href="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~moorthy/Courses/CSCI2961-01-Fall2016/">Intro to Open Source
      Software</a></li>
      <li>Description: An RPI course that familiarizes students with many aspects of working on open source projects.</li>
      <li>Project Goal: Goals are to familiarize students with open source software development, read and understand good
      code, patch an existing open source project or work on a team project, and for students to become aware of team
      dynamics including diversity issues.</li>
      <li>Communication Modes: Slack</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Task 4</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I read Why Coding Style Matters by Nicholas C. Zakas</li>
      <li></li>
      <li>The link was dead, so I had to find the style guide for Java elsewhere. I haven't learned Java yet, so some parts
        meant little to me, but it helped show that companies like Google care about style. The rules don't seem too strict, 
      and I'm guessing a lot of people use those rules anyway without thinking about it.</li>
      <li>In the video, Douglas Crockford, who created JSLint, talks about programming style in Javascript. He thinks it
      is good to make coding style more strict, and be given warnings about style, so that code will be uniform and
      developers will have an easier time reading their code and debugging it. The prettiest or most concise code isn't
      always the clearest code.  He compares it to writing, which has strict rules about punctuation. Some of the things he
      said made a lot of sense, like using "===" instead of "==" in Javascript, since that could easily be a bug someone
      doesn't pick up on. He also said to make global variables stick out by using caps, since they should be uncommon,
      which is something I've seen before. Probably the most controversial issue he mentioned was the use of "++". People
      like using it because it is shorter than writing "+= 1", and some may argue that it is prettier. Also x++ is not equal
      to x += 1, ++x is equal to x += 1. He says it is unnecessary to have another way to add 1, and he never uses "++". I
      personally like using it, as many other people do, so I plan to keep using it. However, I always use "++x" instead of
      "x++", which seems to be the better option. He also mentioned the switch statement issue of having cases fall through,
      which can be easy to do as an accident. I haven't used switch statements for any projects, I've only used them when
      learning languages, but I'll keep the problems of letting cases fall through in mind.</li>
    </ul>
