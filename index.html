  <h1>Lab 11</h1>
  <h2>Task 1</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I set up Pidgin as an IRC client.</li>
      <li></li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Task 2</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I wrote a line in the Titanpad document</li>
      <li></li>
      <li></li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Task 3</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Name:</li>
      <li>Website:</li>
      <li>Description:</li>
      <li>Project Goal:</li>
      <li>Communication Modes:</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Task 4</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I read Why Coding Style Matters by Nicholas C. Zakas</li>
      <li></li>
      <li>The link was dead, so I had to find the style guide for Java elsewhere. I haven't learned Java yet, so some parts
        meant little to me, but it helped show that companies like Google care about style. The rules don't seem to strict, 
      I'm guessing a lot of people use those rules anyway without thinking about it.</li>
