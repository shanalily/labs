**Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?**

**Why they SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license**

**Do you agree with the claim in the Failure to follow the Open System Model Section of Why the Web beat Gopher?**

**Android uses the Apache license 2.0 and it's kernel uses GPL v2, Linux uses tge GPL v2 license, Microsoft .NET Core uses MIT license, SailfishOS is not open source. Can you justify why such a license is chosen (Justification for ONE is enough).**
