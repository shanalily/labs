**Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?**

The license determines what other people can do with your software, so you should determine what freedoms people have with that software. For instance, if you believe it is morally unjust for people to not follow the four criteria of Free Software, you can have a free software license so that anyone can view and change the source code and distribute it with other users. If you want to copyright your work because you don't want other people to be do have the complete freedom to improve your work, you'll have to specify that with a license.

**Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license**

When a project is licensed as open source or something similar, you are being given permission in advance to change it and improve it. If the project is not licensed, you do not know what the creator's original intentions were for the use and distribution were of the project. You have not been given permission to touch their code and therefore you should not touch it.

**Do you agree with the claim in the Failure to follow the Open System Model Section of Why the Web beat Gopher?**

I agree with the claim that when Gopher did not embrace the open source model and pushed away developers, this prevented the advancement that was talked about by Raymond in the Cathedral and the Bazaar. The users of software have an incentive to improve it, and Gopher did not allow that, which allowed the Web to advance and become a better option for users than Gopher.

**Android uses the Apache license 2.0 and it's kernel uses GPL v2, Linux uses tge GPL v2 license, Microsoft .NET Core uses MIT license, SailfishOS is not open source. Can you justify why such a license is chosen (Justification for ONE is enough).**

**Think of an example project. Pick a license (as a group) using the LICENSE chooser by Github.**

**Read these licenses GPL, LGPL and Apache/BSD and discuss which one will be better - for a developer, for a company and for the common good.**

**Create a repository and choose a license.**

**Write five sentences about choosing a project to work in this course and who will be users/customers and what license will you choose.**

**Take 5 projects from Observatory or past RCOS Projects - create a table which project has which license.**
