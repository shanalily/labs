1. I read chapter 9 and downloaded to titanic data to use.<br>
2. I read the background on Association Rule mining and downloaded the two packages<br>

I was able to get rid of all of the redundant rules and cut down the number of rules by about 200.<br>

Below you can see which states Bush won by comparing Bush's points to Kerry's points.<br>

The number of states Bush won can be found by using the length function.<br>

There are 6 Star Wars movies in the data set.<br>

There are 41 movies with the word man in the title.<br>
![number of men](screenshot-area-2017-03-23-230748.png)<br><br>
At first I thought there were 121 sequels.<br>
![number of sequels](screenshot-area-2017-03-23-231203.png)<br><br>
But then I thought I had to make sure the string was at the end of the word, in case there were numbers in the other parts of the title.<br>
![number of sequals II](screenshot-area-2017-03-24-083542.png)<br><br>
Then I remembered that it could be in the middle of the word, I just had to make sure there was space around it or a colon after it. Also there should be a space before the number at the end of the movie title.<br>

This still is an underestimate, because some movies have titles that are harder to recognize as sequels, for instance the Harry Potter movies.<br><br>

At the time of this lab, I had spent some time learning Qt that week by watching and reading what I could find online and trying it myself. I have done more since, which I have written about in my first blog post. Right now, I am trying to figure out how to change path names depending on the operating system, so that opening a file is easier, and figuring out zoom and dimensions of the page, as well as how to display the index that some pdfs have. [Here](https://rcos.io/projects/shanalily/deepreader/profile) is the Observatory page.
