I partnered up with one other person, so we had to find one issue in the documentation for both of us to work on fixing. In the Multimedia chapter in 7.1, there was a typo in the synopsis, where "play back" was spelled as "playback", even though it was being used as a verb and should be spelled as two separate words. Here is the [diff](myfix.diff) we submitted and here is the [commit request](https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=218073).
