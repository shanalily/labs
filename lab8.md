I partnered up with one other person, so we had to find one issue in the documentation for both of us to work on fixing. In the Multimedia chapter in 7.1, there was a typo in the synopsis, where "play back" was spelled as "playback", even though it was being used as a verb and should be spelled as two separate words. Here is the [diff](myfix.diff) we submitted and here is the [commit request](https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=218073).<br>
Documentation is important for both users and developers. If software is supposed to be used, people need to have instructions on how to use it. If the software is to be used in the future, there needs to be documentation so that users and developers do not forget the specifics of how it works. Developers sometimes forget what their own code was supposed to do, and new developers take over projects and shouldn't have difficulty figuring out what the code is supposed to do. Documentation leads to efficiency in using and changing the software and lets clients and developers understands the goals and purposes of the software.
